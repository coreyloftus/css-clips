# CSS Clips

CSS Clips is an app where users can view a database of user created CSS animations in a grid display.
You might think of it as a library of simple CSS animation clips.

I was inspired to create this project when I was looking for simple CSS animations I might include in my own portfolio website. Of course, there's Codepen, but most of the animations on there are super complex, and not vanilla HTML/CSS. And of course, there's Giphy, but I wanted HTML/CSS animations, not GIFs. There had to be somewhere to view a bunch of CSS clips at once... right? I couldn't find one. I realized that if it didn't exist, I would have to create it.

I'm pleased to introduce you to my own personal library of CSS Clips. I'd be honored if you'd contribute to it, and make it yours, as well.

## How to Install and Run the Project

You must have a virtual environment setup to run this project locally. This project is made with Django/Python, so it uses the Python package manager Pip. If you're using Pip...

In the project directory, you can run:

### `pipenv shell`

to launch your virtual environment.

Next, run:

### `python3 manage.py runserver`

Then, navigate to:

### `http://localhost:8000`

You should see the homepage of the app appear.

Create your first clip, and you're up and running.

## How to Use the Project

You might either: use the live hosted site, or clone down and create your own instance...
as a way to keep your own library of cool, simple CSS animations for future reference.
If using my hosted site, please keep it classy.
